# C++ source codes for the Unsupervised Submodular Rank Aggregation on Score-based Permutations. 
To compile the codes, please run the make. Then run the following command to show the performance of Fold1 in MQ2007:
./main --compNDCG=true --nVoters=46 --topK=10 --USraKind=0 data/train.txt data/test.txt

If you use the codes are associated with the paper as below:

Jun Qi, Xu Liu, Javier Tejedor, Shunsuke Kamijo, "Unsupervised Submodular Rank Aggregation on Score-based Permutations", arXiv:1707.01166.'
